        Student-FRIEndly extension to the TCP/IP protocol Suite
                       draft-kuladinithi-fries-00

Abstract

   Protocols of the TCP/IP protocol suite were designed solely to adapt
   to the technical changes in networks and devices, leaving out users'
   feelings.  COVID-19 pandemic has shown us the necessity of including
   mechanisms in TCP/IP to support the context-sensitive human thought
   process, especially to serve pupils and students.  This memo
   describes the student-FRIEndly TCP/IP protocol Suite (FRIES) that
   caters to the quick adaptation of TCP/IP to serve students in a
   virtual context.  This mode of operation should not be used in
   physically present meetings (e.g., lectures or oral examinations), as
   the protocol behavior does not match with the actual activities or
   expressions.

   FRIES is a highly deployable protocol extension, maintaining backward
   compatibility with the current TCP/IP stack.

1.  Introduction

   The COVID-19 pandemic has forced humans, especially the young
   generations, to use the Internet in ways it was not intended to be
   used.  For example, the use of on-line lectures at universities for
   lengthy periods of time, without any social interactions.  This
   demotivates students.  Interactions with students have shown us that
   a life with no social interactions, sitting in front of a computer
   all day, without any banter with friends in a physical setting has
   negatively affected the younger generations' appetite for education.

   The FRIES extension introduces some novel features to the current
   TCP/IP stack to serve diverse behavior patterns (physical or mental)
   of users by manipulating the protocol behavior to serve users'
   feelings.  Sometimes, students do not want to attire appropriately or
   be prepared to engage in lectures.  Students prefer to listen only to
   some keywords from the lecture, while lounging on the bed and even,

   playing on-line games.  When they are asked to talk or join a
   breakout room discussion, students pretend wanting to talk even
   without any clue of what to say.

   Therefore, the TCP/IP protocol suite MUST support mechanisms to
   handle the following behavioral patterns irrespective of the
   underline network changes.

   o  Delayed joining of on-line lectures

   o  Enabling intermittent disruptions to appear as having connectivity
      problems (e.g., when using a shared white-board application)

   o  Introduce artificial artefacts (audio/video) when no proper
      answers can be given

   o  Seamless handover of active on-line lectures between multiple
      devices to enable home furniture carousel/musical chairs

   This document specifies the use of new and existing protocol features
   to describe the FRIES extension to the TCP/IP protocol suite, to
   implement student-friendly virtual communications.  All the features
   proposed MUST be incorporated in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

1.1.  The Need for Standardization

   Our lives have been turned upside down in many areas, including
   education, due to the never-ending pandemic that started at the
   beginning of 2020.  Everyone now recognizes the seriousness of the
   impact of the pandemic.  Therefore, it is imperative that
   standardization bodies among others, move quickly to adopt new
   standards to accommodate features that make life livable during a
   pandemic.

   The FRIES extension primarily focuses on our future generation to
   survive and enjoy their education.

   The automatic detection of the students' thought process or
   intentions to enable the expected behavioral pattern is beyond the
   scope of this document.  A possibility is the use of machine learning
   techniques to recognize facial expressions and environmental
   conditions.

2.1.  General

   Pandemic friendliness of the TCP/IP protocol suite is defined by
   introducing the pandemic bit to the IP header and the TCP header.
   Backward compatibility of the existing TCP/IP protocols is kept
   intact when P bit is not set.

         | P | Version   |
         +---+---+---+---+

            Figure 1: Pandemic bit in IP Header - Version field

   The most significant bit, MSB of the Version field of both IPv4
   [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC8200] header MUST be modified to handle the
   pandemic situation.  The pandemic bit is defined as the P bit, see
   Figure 1.  As the current IP version field is used to represent only
   number 4 and 6, the use of the left most bit as the pandemic bit
   results in no major changes to the existing IP header.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

           Figure 2: Pandemic bit in TCP Header - Reserved flags

   The MSB of the Reserved flags of TCP header [RFC0793] SHALL also be
   modified to indicate the pandemic situation, see Figure 2.  Setting
   the P bit to 0 means business-as-usual with TCP/IP operations.

   Setting P bit to 1 enables FRIES extensions for TCP/IP.  Any entity
   (e.g., applications, routers) which encounters packets with the P bit
   set SHALL support some or all of the behavioral patterns described in
   Section 1.

   The following sections describe how the extensions MUST operate on
   routers, end-hosts and how seamless handovers are performed.

2.2.  Operation on Routers

   This section describes how a router MUST behave when there is a
   pandemic.  Figure 3 shows the common format of the TOS field of IPv4
   and the Traffic Class field of IPv6, as defined in [RFC2474] and

   [RFC3168], which are requested to assist the router during a
   pandemic.

         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
         |  DS FIELD, DSCP       | ECN   |
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

        DSCP: differentiated services code point
        ECN:  Explicit Congestion Notification

      During the pandemic: DSCP = 000000 and ECN = 00 or 01 or 10


        Figure 3: The Differentiated Services and ECN Fields in IP

   When P bit is set in the IP Version field, the routers treat all
   pandemic packets as follows.

   o  When dropping application packets is enabled for a certain period,
      the IP header of the packets generated during the mentioned period
      should be set by the originating host as follows:

      1.  P bit MUST be set to 1 in the IP Version field

      2.  DSCP MUST be set as best-effort traffic only, six most
          significant (left-most) bits to 000000, see Figure 3.

      3.  ECN MAY be set to indicate the Code Points as defined in
          [RFC3168].

   o  If the P bit of the IP header is set, routers MUST treat this
      packet without any prioritization and start dropping the packets
      randomly, irrespective of the ECN values.  When there is no
      pandemic, the routers shall treat the DSCP values as defined in
      [RFC2474].  For example, audio and video packets get higher
      priority at router's queue while keeping the drop probability to a
      minimum or none.

   o  If ECN is set to 01 or 10, the router shall indicate the explicit
      network congestion as defined in [RFC3168] irrespective of the P
      bit is set or not.  It is recommended to set ECN to 00 during a
      pandemic as the artificial dropping of packets at a router is more
      efficient compared to the use of explicit congestion notification
      to the end hosts.

   o  The dropping policy at the router is implementation-specific.

   o  At least the last hop router MUST implement the dropping of
      packets randomly if the P bit is set.  The routers may identify
      whether it's the last hop router or not by comparing the Subnet
      Prefix of the destination IP address.

   o  Other routers may also implement the dropping of packets to handle
      pandemic situation, depending on the seriousness level.  The
      identification of a number of routers that may drop packets is out
      of the scope of this document.

2.3.  Operation on End-hosts

   TCP congestion and flow control mechanisms are kept intact during the
   pandemic.  However, enabling the P bit in TCP header results in
   following extensions.

   o  If the P bit is set in both IP and TCP header, the TCP receiver
      shall ignore in order packet delivery to the application.  This is
      indicated to the TCP receiver by setting the P bit to 1 and PSH
      flag to 1 by the TCP sender.  TCP receiver MUST forward the packet
      to the application without any delay.  Some of the lost packets
      may not be recovered at all depending on the dropping policy
      implemented at the last hop router due to the pandemic.

   o  The delivery of out of order packets may result in artefacts in
      the applications, as the TCP does not perform reliably due to the
      pandemic.

   o  If a student decides only to listen, mimicking serious network
      issues, FRIES protocol shall use the beauty of TCP half connection
      close feature, showing a frozen connection state of the student's
      state on the TCP receiver.  The TCP sender (e.g., the student's
      laptop) shall send FIN message with the P bit set to the TCP
      receiver even though it continues to receive the application
      packets.

   o  At the receipt of FIN message with the P bit set, the TCP receiver
      knows that this is a request for abrupt termination due to the
      pandemic.

   o  Not accepting application packets, without creating TCP segments
      at the TCP sender, shall be allowed at the transport layer during
      a pandemic.  The acceptance policy at the transport layer is
      implementation-specific.

2.4.  Enabling Seamless Handovers

   This operation is valid only for the local network in case a student
   intends to perform furniture carousel/musical chairs to overcome the
   monotonous nature of lectures.  Considering that a student wishes to
   use multiple devices at different places (see Figure 4), then the
   student SHALL switch on all devices at the start for the home router
   to perform furniture carousel/musical chairs.

   o  Switching on all devices results in registering the relevant
      devices at the home router.

   o  Home router multicasts incoming packets to all the registered
      devices.

   o  The home router MUST maintain a pandemic table which shows the
      list of active devices indicating the primary device and cost
      metrics to manage the bandwidth usage depending on a student's
      concentration level (e.g., when at kitchen, home router MAY reduce
      the amount of incoming packets forwarded as the student is anyway
      not focused).

2.5.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  IANA Considerations

   If this work is standardized, IANA is kindly requested to introduce
   the Pandemic bit in IPv4, IPv6 and TCP headers.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security is considered unimportant as the FRIES extension is solely
   designed for the use of students.

5.  Acknowledgement

   COVID-19 pandemic let us have more evening walks together compared to
   the time before.  This RFC is a result of these walks and therefore
   we are grateful for COVID-19 for allowing us to think out of the box.
